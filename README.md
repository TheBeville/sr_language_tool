# SR Tool

Inspired by spaced repetition tools, such as the ANKI system (the ANKIdroid app, in particular), 
I wanted to make an app that was tailored a bit more to myself. Gone are things like the 'leech'
tag and automatic suspending of cards if incorrectly identified a handful of times - something
I could never disable in ANKIdroid, if it's even possible, which made memorising tricky kanji
very frustrating.
