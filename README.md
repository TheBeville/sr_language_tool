# SR Tool

Inspired by spaced repetition tools, such as the ANKI system (the AnkiDroid app, in particular), 
I wanted to make an app that was tailored a bit more to myself. Gone are things like the 'leech'
tag and automatic suspending of cards if incorrectly identified a handful of times - something
I could never disable in AnkiDroid, if it's even possible, which made memorising tricky kanji
very frustrating.

## Getting Started

Add a language, and then you can begin adding flashcards as you discover new words in the language. 
The card creation page comes with different word categories (noun, adjective, verb etc.) and optional 
values, such as the gender of a word, its plural form, or even pronunciation guides and example usage.

Once you've added a few cards, you can view a list of them all on the language's overview page and
see see when each card is due for review (determined by the ANKI-inspired spaced repetition system).

When you wish to review, hit the 'Review' button at the top of the language's overview page to 
enter the review mode, where you will be shown the card's 'front content' (the word in its 
original language) and when you've _hopefully_ remembered the word, tap it to reveal the rest of 
the card. At the bottom of the screen, there are four options to choose depending on whether you 
were able to successfully remember the word and/or how easy it was to do so. These options determine 
when the card will next be marked for review again.
